## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

#### When or why I would use this?

You should use this if you want to build a bitcoin wallet, payment processor, or
bitcoin merchant portal in javascript. You might also be interested in why
decentralized networks or p2p applications are useful, or what advantages they
have; this project seems like a good way to learn about that.

#### What is the block chain actually for?

The blockchain is for authorizing payments of a cryptocurrency between two peers
without the need for a centralized 3rd party approving of the transaction. There
are other uses of the blockchain which are more in line with the second point,
digital signatures, but they are secondary to the main purpose of peer to peer
transfer of value. Bitcoin is blockchain's killer app.

#### Why the hell should I care about the blockchain?

Blockchain facilitates trade over a network. Imagine a metal as scarce as gold
with a magical property of "can be transported over a communications channel".
This has implications with respect to individual rights, the world economy, and
the way we monetize and transfer value at a level higher than bartering directly
for goods.

Lately people are distancing themselves from the proof-of-work concept and are
using blockchain to describe only the mechanism of signing a transaction as
verification of sending an amount. Change "sending an amount" to almost anything
else - authorizing a change in a ruleset, casting a vote for a politician,
verifying a point of IoT data is authentic. Now add in the concept of a
peer-to-peer network to this and you've eliminated a middleman that once
existed, thereby improving the efficiency and reducing cost. In these cases,
"blockchain" refers to the structuring of a program or database in such a way
that it has no central point of failure while still providing all of the
features expected. For example, augur and gnosis are decentralized prediction
markets. Ethereum has implemented smart contracts which enable decentralized
release of funds based on a gambling outcome.
